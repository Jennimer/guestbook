Jenni Merisalo's guestbook App

You can write your messages and read messages to left by others 


This assigment was hard for me, because I didn't find good examples. The first version was totally unfinished, and I load the new one, but there is still couple of problem to solve. Like how this messages can displayed to the Ajaxmessage page.
And I still try to get it work and deploy it to the cloud service soon, if this isn't grated before that.

Ok, you can find it from render, https://guestbookjenni.onrender.com
