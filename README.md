 ## What learned

This assigment was hard for me, because I didn't find good examples, but the project was a good exercise in how to do things in a more difficult and less functional way than you can do today. There were still a couple of problems with the project requirements that I didn't solve. 


Ok, you can find it from render, https://guestbookjenni.onrender.com
